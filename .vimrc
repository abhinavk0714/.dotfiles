I created a file called .vimrc in my home directory and using the VIM editor, I inserted a bunch of configurations that customized my VIM text editor. I then saved this file and then copied and renamed it to my desktop directory to turn in to dropbox.

syntax on
set ruler 
set autoindent
set number
set ignorecase
